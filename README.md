#Advanced Hemodialysis Optimization : Data-Driven Approach to Urea Clearance and Patient Recovery

This project focuses on optimizing hemodialysis treatment by analyzing clinical data from 5,000 patients. It aims to identify key factors affecting urea clearance and overall treatment effectiveness. Advanced data analytics and modeling are used to personalize dialysis strategies. The project explores the integration of nanotechnology to support faster urea reduction and patient recovery. Ultimately, it seeks to enhance outcomes and quality of life for individuals undergoing dialysis.

This hemodialysis dataset provides detailed information about patients undergoing dialysis treatment. It typically includes personal details like age and weight, clinical measurements such as blood pressure and heart rate, and laboratory test results like urea and creatinine levels before and after dialysis. The dataset may also contain dialysis session details—like duration, frequency, and flow rates—which are important for understanding how the treatment is administered. By analyzing these variables, researchers or clinicians can assess how effective each dialysis session is in removing waste from the blood. This kind of data is valuable for improving patient outcomes and personalizing treatment plans.
